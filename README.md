# PHPVM

phpvm is a very simple PHP version manager / switcher. It's a bash script, and it allows us to switch between installed (with Homebrew) PHP versions on macOS.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/sptmru/phpvm`

`cp phpvm.sh /usr/local/bin/phpvm`

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/phpvm`

## Usage

`phpvm <version>`, for example: `phpvm 8.0`, `phpvm 7.4`. Quite simple :)
